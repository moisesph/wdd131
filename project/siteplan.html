    <!-- I have created a copy of the pokemons html in the main carpet to avoid issues with the validator and
another one in the subcarpet.

4. Site Name: The name is 9 Hours Initial Pokemon because sometimes when you start playing  a game RPG, you repent 
of what initial character you choose and you reset the game, knowing which one would you like can save you 9 hours!,
 and initial pokemon to make it descriptive 
 
 5. Site Purpose: Is to help you to know which is the best option to choose and information about them, as an extra
 feature it helps you to download the games!

 6. Scenarios: Which pokemon should I start with?
 Where can I download them?

 7. Color Scheme: In the css, in the root: I put which colors I will use

 11. Wireframes: I took screenshoots in the wire-frames carpet
